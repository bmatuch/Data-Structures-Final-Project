# Data-Structures-Final-Project

This repository contains two files: orderprep.py and reg_orderprep.py. 
The first file ulitizes a priority queue to complete restaurant orders based upon how far away a student is from said restaurant when placing their order. 
The second file processes orders in a first-in, first-out ordering.
