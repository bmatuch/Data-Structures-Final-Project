# Data-Structures-Final-Project

This repository contains three files: orderprep.py, orderprep_animated.py and reg_orderprep.py. 
1. The first file ulitizes a priority queue to complete restaurant orders based upon how far away a student is from said restaurant when placing their order.
2. The second file works in the same way as the first, except, the orders are displayed in an animation, similar to the way a digital order processing board at a restaurant would.
3. The third file processes orders in a first-in, first-out ordering.
